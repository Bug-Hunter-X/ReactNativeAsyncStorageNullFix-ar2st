# React Native AsyncStorage Intermittent null Return

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using AsyncStorage in React Native.  The `AsyncStorage.getItem` method intermittently returns `null`, even when the key exists and a value is associated with it. This inconsistency makes reliable data retrieval challenging.

## Problem Description

The problem is the unpredictable nature of `AsyncStorage.getItem`.  While most of the time it functions correctly, there are instances where it fails to retrieve the expected value, instead returning `null`.  This isn't linked to any particular key or value but appears to be a timing or asynchronous operation issue.

## Solution

The solution provided adds error handling and a retry mechanism using `setTimeout`. By introducing a delay before making another attempt to retrieve data, the problem is mitigated significantly.  The retry mechanism makes the data retrieval more robust.
